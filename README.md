# Simple-PINNs
In this repository we use Physics Informed Neural Networks to solve simple ODEs/PDEs. Currently, there is only one file (Transport.ipynb) which follows the implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12393v2 (Ch.16) to solve a transport equation with smooth velocity and initial condition.
